Problem Description
I read many online forums as a source of news and entertainment; however, most of the content on theseforums is impermanent. 
This means that over time, old content is removed as new content is generated. Stitch, a web-based forum archiever, will be able to 
grab and store forum content permanently on a web server for later consumption by the user. 

System Capabilities
The system will be able to:
- Access and search several forums, and be expandable for the addition of more
- Process and handle several requests at once;
- Accurately use user input parameters to return relavant content
