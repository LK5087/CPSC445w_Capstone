Plan your weight loss week by week https:\\/\\/www.losertown.org\\/eats\\/cal.php 6. Track your calories and macros with MyFitnessPal or Cronometer. Don&#039;t listen to memes, either of these are fine based on what you need. https:\\/\\/www.myfitnesspal.com (better for packaged food) https:\\/\\/www.cronometer.com (better for generic food\\/tracking micronutrients) &gt;Now what do I do? Count calories, all of them. Calculate your TDEE at sedentary. Buy scales, be accurate in your measurements. Learn how to cook. Try to stick to lean protein and green vegetables. Eat a lot of protein. 1g per lb of goal body weight. Do cardio. Even if its just walking, cardio will improve your health which is sorely needed. There is no such thing as a healthy fat heart, but you can off set the risks. Lift weights. This will keep and gain muscle mass and burn fat much quicker. No lifting results in the body burning away muscle AND fat. You don&#039;t want this. Post your height\\/weight\\/screenshot of MFP\\/Cronometer food log when asking for advice &gt;DON&#039;T Eat refined sugars, they&#039;re terrible for you regardless of calorie count Eat processed foods, or at least try to avoid if possible Drink your calories. Alcohol, soda, hot chocolate, fancy starbucks shit. forget it. Freak out over a stall in weight loss.

Whether it be in highschool, university or my peers now, nobody thinks like this(at least out loud). But that&#039;s what&#039;s got me so confused. I understand that in things such as fantasy fiction, you can have male and female characters doing extraordinary things, so long as you make, it believable IN THE CONTEXT of the universe you&#039;ve built. No problem with that. But I was discussing the new DOOM movie with someone today who mentioned how it got review bombed because of sexism. One thing led to another and we ended up discussing real life soldiers\\/fire-fighters and how few women actually see combat roles or special forces. I argued that it wasn&#039;t just passing physicals, but being able to perform consistently and that even in real life the very same politicians yapping about feminism and forced* equality, run around with male bodyguards for personal protection over women. Bringing it back to more \\/fit\\/ related stuff though. I in my own life have never seen anything except for co-ed sports being reasonable for men and women. Even amongst men, we tend to look down on men who use test boosting supplements in competition because it&#039;s considered cheating and gaining an advantage.
